# Many to Many

Start out with an application that has a 1 to many relationship between users and messages (a user has many messages, a message belongs to 1 user).  Add a tag feature in which a tag can have many messages and a message can have many tags.

Your app should have the following features:

* Full CRD on tags (no update)
	* The show page for a message should show all tags
