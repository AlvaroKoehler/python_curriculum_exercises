# Classes

### Application

- Inheritance (Multiple)
- Class methods
- Instance methods

### Bonus

Refactor your file-io example into a class called `FileManipulator`. This class should implement a method called `addLine` and `printLines`, which should be implemented in the two classes that inherit from it using Polymorphism. These classes should be called `CSVManipulator` and `TextManipulator` and both should be able to add and read to files.
