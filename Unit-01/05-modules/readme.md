# Modules

Refactor your file-io example and create two separate files, one for your functions called `helpers.py` and another file called `main.py`, which imports the functions. Your `main.py` file should import all the functions written in `helpers.py` for reading files, writing to files and CSVs as well. 

Make sure your modules contain a `if __name__ == '__main__':` statement.
