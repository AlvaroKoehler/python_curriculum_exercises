# Python Basics

### Python vs. JavaScript

Complete the exercises below by writing an expression in JavaScript and Python that complete the same task. The first example has been done for you. Feel free to consult the docs for these languages if you get stuck!

1. Declare a variable called `first` and assign it to the value `"Hello World"`.

	```js
	var first = "Hello World";
	```
	
	```py
	first = "Hello World"
	```

2. Write a comment that says "This is a comment."

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
3. Show a message to the console / terminal that says "I AM A COMPUTER!"

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
4. Write an if statement that checks if `1` is less than `2` and if `4` is greater than `2`. If it is, show the message "Math is fun."

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
5. Assign a variable called `nope` to an absence of value.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
6. Use the language's "and" boolean operator to combine the language's "true" value with its "false" value.

	```js
	```

	```
	
8. Convert the string "i am shouting" to uppercase.

	```js
	```

	```
	
9. Convert the string `"1000"` to the number `1000`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
10. Combine the number `4` with the string `"real"` to produce `"4real"`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
11. Record the output of the expression `3 * "cool"`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
12. Record the output of the expression `1 / 0`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
13. Determine the type of `[]`. 

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
14. Ask the user for their name, and store it in a variable called `name`.

	```
	
	```py
	```
	
15. Ask the user for a number. If the number is negative, show a message that says `"That number is less than 0!"` If the number is positive, show a message that says `"That number is greater than 0!"` Otherwise, show a message that says `"You picked 0!`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
16. Find the index of `"l"` in `"apple"`.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
17. Check whether `"y"` is in `"xylophone"`.

	```js

	```py
	```
	
18. Check whether a string called `str` is all in lowercase.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
19. Create two variables, `nums1` and `nums2`. Both should store an array / list of the values [1, 2, 3]. Check whether `nums1` and `nums2` refer to the same object.

	```js
	```
	
	```py
	```
	
20. Create two variables, `nums1` and `nums2`. Both should store an array / list of the values [1, 2, 3]. Check whether `nums1` and `nums2` have the same values.
